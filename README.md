## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Display time of current location.
- Display a random quote.
- Display some stats based on time and location.

### Screenshot

![](<./images/screenshot.png>)

<!-- Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above. -->

<!-- **Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.** -->

<!-- To see how you can add code snippets, see below: -->

```html
 <div id="myDIV">
        <div class="currentTimezone">
            <p>CURRENT TIMEZONE</p>
            <p class="currentPlace stats"></p>
        </div>
        <div class="dayYear">
            <p>DAY OF THE YEAR</p>
            <p class="currentDayYear stats"></p>
        </div>
        <div class="dayWeek">
            <p>DAY OF THE WEEK</p>
            <p class="currentDayWeek stats"></p>
        </div>
        <div class="weekNumber">
            <p>WEEK NUMBER</p>
            <p class="currentWeekNumber stats"></p>
        </div>
```

```css
#refresh {
	background-color: transparent;
	font-size: xx-large;
	color: none;
	border: none;
}

.main {
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
	margin-top: 300px;

	align-items: center;
	/* aligns items in x axis */
}
```

```js
window.onload = function () {
	showTime();
	updateQuote();
	findMe();
	document.getElementById('myDIV').style.display = 'none';
